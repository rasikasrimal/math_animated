# Math Animated 📊🎬

A collection of mathematical animations created with [Manim](https://www.manim.community/), designed to visualize and explain mathematical concepts through engaging animated videos.

## 🎯 Features

This repository contains animated visualizations for:

- **Algebra**: Quadratic functions, transformations, and vertex analysis
- **Geometry**: Circle properties, area, circumference calculations
- **Calculus**: Derivatives, limits, and rate of change visualization
- **Linear Algebra**: Vector operations, addition, subtraction, and dot products

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rasikasrimal/math_animated.git
cd math_animated
```

2. **Quick Setup (Recommended)**: Run the setup script:
```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

3. **Manual Setup**: Install dependencies manually:
```bash
# Install system dependencies (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt-get install build-essential python3-dev libcairo2-dev libpango1.0-dev

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running Animations

Use the main script to run animations:

```bash
# Preview what animations do (no Manim required)
python demo.py

# List all available animations
python main.py list

# Run a specific animation
python main.py quadratic
python main.py circle
python main.py derivative
python main.py vectors

# Run all animations
python main.py all

# Specify video quality (low_quality, medium_quality, high_quality)
python main.py quadratic --quality high_quality
```

## 📋 Available Animations

| Animation | Command | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Quadratic Functions | `quadratic` | Visualizes quadratic function transformations and vertex properties |
| Circle Geometry | `circle` | Demonstrates circle area, circumference, and geometric relationships |
| Derivative Visualization | `derivative` | Shows derivatives as limits of secant lines |
| Vector Operations | `vectors` | Illustrates vector addition, subtraction, and dot products |

## 🎨 Animation Details

### Quadratic Functions
- Visualizes parabolas with different coefficients
- Shows vertex transformations
- Demonstrates the effect of the 'a' coefficient on curve shape

### Circle Geometry
- Interactive visualization of radius, diameter, and center
- Real-time calculation of area and circumference
- Dynamic resizing to show relationship changes

### Derivative Visualization
- Shows secant lines approaching tangent lines
- Visualizes the limit process
- Demonstrates instantaneous rate of change

### Vector Operations
- Vector addition using parallelogram method
- Vector subtraction visualization
- Scalar multiplication effects
- Dot product calculation and interpretation

## 🛠️ Development

### Adding New Animations

1. Create a new Python file in the appropriate category folder
2. Import Manim and create a Scene class
3. Implement the `construct` method with your animation logic
4. Update `main.py` to include your new animation in the `ANIMATIONS` dictionary

Example structure:
```python
from manim import *

class YourAnimationName(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        # Your animation code here
        pass
```

### Dependencies

- **Manim**: Mathematical animation engine
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations
- **Matplotlib**: Additional plotting utilities
- **SciPy**: Scientific computing functions
- **Pillow**: Image processing

## 🎥 Output

All animations are rendered as MP4 videos and saved in the `media/` directory. The default quality is set to medium for a balance between file size and visual quality.
